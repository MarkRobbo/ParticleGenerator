# Particle Generator

This is an OpenGL application for simple particle simulation. It currently implements Newtonian 
physics and the [Lorenz Strange Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) and 
has easy expandability for more physics models and emitter types.

# Building

This project requires OpenGL and FreeGLUT to be installed and uses CMake for compilation
